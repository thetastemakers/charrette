            Dave Snowden, extending Michael Polanyi’s observation about tacit knowledge, puts it simply: we know more than we can say, and
            we can say more than we can write down. His paper “Complex Acts of Knowing” rejects the idea that organisational knowledge
            reduces to a complete repository of documents. For Charrette that is a design constraint. Project memory shouldn’t claim to
            capture everything. It should make the limits of its knowledge visible.

            Repeated interventions can reveal a candidate policy, but <b>promotion is deliberate</b>.

            Claims that haven’t been supplied or checked in a long time are <b>flagged as possibly stale</b>, not trusted by default.

            At team scale the problem gets harder. Context should be shared, but not all of it belongs at organisation level. A deployment
            policy may be shared; a temporary workaround should not be. The relationship between organisation, project and task is a
            research question, not just a database hierarchy.
