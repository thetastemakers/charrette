            Charrette is a control plane above coding agents. It owns the durable representation of the project and its tasks. Agents are
            workers, chosen for capability, availability, cost or trust.

            Charrette drives the official agent tools through their own interfaces, under their own terms, on the user’s own plans. It holds
            no model weights and resells no tokens. The only thing it owns is the project record, and that is stored in an open format the
            team can read without Charrette.

          <p>
            Acceptance criteria are part of the task before execution begins, and evidence is attached as the work proceeds. A task is
            complete when its claims are supported: tests passed against a named revision, an independent review examined that revision,
            visual evidence matches the deployed output, and remaining risks are either cleared or explicitly accepted. “The agent said it
            was done” is not an acceptance state.

            What moves between providers is project and task state: objective, criteria, worktree or diff, decisions, completed steps,
            tests, open questions, artifacts and provenance. What doesn’t move is the hidden state of each provider’s session: its tools,
            context window, approvals, memory behaviour and model behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>We promise</b> that a task survives provider swaps, retries, machine loss and migration. <b>We don’t promise</b> identical
            sessions or identical outcomes across agents.
