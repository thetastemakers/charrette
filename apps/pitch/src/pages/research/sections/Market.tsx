            Over the past year, the major AI coding companies have all moved from the agent towards the project around it: persistent
            knowledge, cloud tasks, review flows, multi-agent coordination. That validates the category. It also shows its incentive
            structure. Each vendor ties the project layer to what it sells.

            <strong>Vertical integration is rational for each vendor and costly for each customer.</strong> A memory that moves cleanly to a
            competitor stops keeping customers, so no vendor has a reason to make its memory portable, or to route work to a rival’s model
            when that model is better this month.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The tools churn faster than projects do.</strong> The strongest coding model has changed hands repeatedly over the past
            eighteen months, and relative prices swing just as often. Open-weight models keep closing the gap, and new labs keep arriving. A
            team could spend weeks evaluating models and still not have an answer that holds for a quarter. Tying project context to one
            tool means paying for it at every switch.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Subscription economics favour an orchestrator of official tools.</strong> Frontier models are far cheaper through the
            subscription plans developers already hold than through metered API pricing. A layer that coordinates the official agent tools
            under their own terms passes that saving on. A layer that resells tokens can’t.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Independence is a quality feature.</strong> Review by a model from a different lab than the author catches failures the
            author’s model family shares. No lab can sell an independent reviewer of its own model.
