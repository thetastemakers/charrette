            The expensive part of an interruption isn’t the minute it takes to answer. It’s the loss of focus: noticing a run has stopped,
            reloading its context, deciding, briefing the next agent, then finding your place in your own work again. Charrette draws a hard
            line around what’s allowed to spend that attention.
