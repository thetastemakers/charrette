            Coding agents have crossed a threshold. They implement substantial changes, operate tools, run tests and respond to review. The
            operating model around them still looks like a collection of chat windows.

            Project context is fragmented, continuity belongs to individual products, and developers spend their attention carrying
            information between specialist agents. Charrette proposes an open, provider-independent project layer. It holds durable intent
            and evidence, while a coordinator composes execution graphs around replaceable workers. The purpose is not to remove developer
            judgment. It is to stop spending that judgment on clerical coordination.
