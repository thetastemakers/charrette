            Changing a mature system takes more than the repository. It takes the current goal, architectural intent, business constraints,
            approaches that already failed, temporary exceptions, local conventions, deployment risk, acceptance criteria, and the reasons
            one trade-off beat another.
          </p>

            Today that knowledge is spread across instruction files (READMEs, <code>AGENTS.md</code>, provider-specific rules), issues and
            pull requests, individual agent conversations and their compacted summaries, and the heads of developers who know which written
            rules are still current. The evidence, meaning diffs, test runs, logs and incidents, is rarely connected to the decisions it
            supports.
          </p>
          <p>
            Documentation helps, but it flattens different kinds of knowledge. A Markdown file can hold text. It usually can’t say whether a
            statement is a settled policy, a hypothesis, a decision that applies to one service, an observation from a failed run, or a
            convention that went stale in February. Current practice puts all five into similar files and asks the next agent to guess their
            authority.

            Promotion is a decision, with an author and a date. Most observations should never be promoted. When two claims disagree,
            neither is quietly merged; both stay visible, marked as contested, until someone settles it.

            Agent products increasingly organise memory by <em>when text enters the model’s context</em>: always-on rules, instructions
            scoped to certain files, and skills loaded on demand when their description seems relevant. It’s a sound engineering answer to a
            real constraint, because context windows are finite and long instructions dilute attention. In 2026 some products went further
            and merged their separate knowledge stores into on-demand skills, because the two already loaded the same way.
          </p>
          <p>
            But that merges two separate questions. <strong>Is this claim true?</strong> is a question about the project.{' '}
            <strong>When should an agent see it?</strong> is a question about delivery. A procedure for running a migration and the fact
            that a payment provider’s webhooks arrive out of order both load on demand, but only one of them can go stale, be contradicted
            or be superseded. Charrette keeps the two axes separate.

            Cursor, GitHub, Devin and the labs’ own agents all now offer coherent project surfaces, cloud agents, repository-aware work and
            durable artifacts. That’s strong evidence the need is real. It also creates a structural risk: if a project’s memory, task
            history and coordination rules live inside one commercial environment, the team’s accumulated operating knowledge becomes part
            of that vendor’s moat. Changing the model is easy. Changing the system that remembers how the team builds is not. Charrette
            therefore treats provider independence as an architectural requirement, not a model picker.
