        <h2>Continuous supervision may need small decisions, not another general-purpose agent.</h2>
        <div className={s.prose}>
          <p>
            Many graph transitions aren’t writing tasks. They’re bounded judgments: does this result need repair, which specialist should
            review it, is the evidence sufficient, does this uncertainty warrant a person? TypeSafe’s September 2026 release of Jev
            introduces a model designed to return typed choices, scores and probabilities rather than text. Its interface is unusually
            relevant here.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hypothesis is not that Jev should become Charrette’s coordinator. It’s that a fast, probabilistic decision model could
            become a supervision primitive used throughout the product, while the coordinator’s rules, state and history remain open and
            inspectable.

              <p>
                A decision model scores narrow choices (continue, review, repair, investigate, escalate) with a probability distribution.

            The model never invents an arbitrary graph. The coordinator offers only the transitions project policy allows. Above a
            calibrated threshold, it takes low-risk transitions automatically. In the middle, it asks for a stronger model or more evidence.
            Below, it escalates. Every decision stores its inputs, choices, full distribution, threshold, model version and the graph change
            it caused.

            <strong>The boundary.</strong> A decision engine can’t turn a vague feature request into a useful graph, plan an implementation,
            write or deeply review code, diagnose a novel failure or resolve an architectural trade-off. Those remain jobs for generative
            agents and people. It is most valuable where the candidate answers can be defined in advance and the same narrow question is
            asked thousands of times.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Open interface, closed model.</strong> Jev is not open source; access is through TypeSafe’s hosted API, while its SDKs
            and a compatibility adapter built on ordinary LLM APIs are MIT-licensed. So the abstraction boundary matters. Charrette should
            own an open decision-engine contract and treat Jev as one optional provider, alongside constrained frontier models, smaller
            open-weight models and deterministic implementations. Project policy must never depend on an uncalibrated, provider-specific
            confidence scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>An evaluation target, not a dependency.</strong> TypeSafe reports latency of roughly 70–500 ms, typed outputs,
            calibrated confidence and large cost advantages. Its published evaluations are company-run and use frontier-model consensus as
            the reference. A first benchmark should replay labelled events from real review, test and repair loops, and measure routing
            precision and recall (especially false acceptance and missed escalation), calibration, workflow outcomes, latency and cost at
            scale, robustness to contradictory or adversarial state, and portability across providers.

            <p>
              a typed decision engine materially cuts latency, cost or unnecessary interruptions while matching a strong general model on
              safety-relevant judgments.

              confidence is poorly calibrated, false acceptance is hard to bound, or the integration makes project policy depend on one
              closed model.
